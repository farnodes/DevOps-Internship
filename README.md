### DevOps Lifecycle
DevOps is a continuous procedure. It describes an active connection between development and operations. In DevOps, all partners including engineers, add to making the organization's procedure quicker, progressively effective and consistent. 


This article will discuss DevOps Lifecycle and the phases/stages necessary to understand DevOps Lifecycle.

 
What is DevOps lifecycle?
TO understand the DevOps, it is essential to understand the stages of the DevOps lifecycle. The continuous DevOps lifecycle incorporates seven stages as discussed below:

1. Continuous Development
In this DevOps stage, the development of software happens continually. The entire development procedure is isolated into little development cycles. In this way, it becomes easier for a DevOps team to accelerate software development and distribution procedure.



2. Continuous Integration
Continuous Integration demands a working connection between development and operational teams. So as to accomplish this, integration must be performed right on time and all developments understandable to every member of the teams. During this stage, computerization is required for procedures, for example, code compilation, unit, and acceptance testing. At that point serving the code for deployment is needed. 

Automation must be interrelated so that if engineers perform any action or adjust the code, it should be recognized by the build framework. On this stage, stability tests are done and the build is presented on a source.



3. Continuous Testing
Testing procedure analyzes the real utilization of an application within the DevOps. Beta analyzers generate outcomes. Still, they make sure that application is able to have its expected use in a live domain. The testing procedure gives additional data about various dimensions of an application that is directed to the development procedure to advance the application.

4.  Continuous Monitoring
In this stage, the activity group will deal with the unseemly framework conduct or bugs which are discovered in production.

5.     Continuous Feedback
Feedback is important to computerized releases. Continuous feedback provides information to all stakeholders with respect to what is being sent and what issues are being occurred. In DevOps, feedback is considered as information that is gathered from the client. It is basically a contribution by the client to complete planning and development. The gathered information contains significant data about the performance and any issue that is experienced by the end-user.



6. Continuous Deployment
The deployment procedure is accomplished so that any advancements made in the code must not influence the working of high traffic sites.

7. Continuous Operations
All DevOps operations depend on consistency and delivery procedure is completely computerized.  It enables companies to quicken the general time of advertising.

Now you have understood what DevOps Life cycle is. It is obvious from the article that continuousness is the basic factor in DevOps which removes the overflowing steps. These abundant steps resist the development, take it longer to identify problems and create a superior version of the item.
