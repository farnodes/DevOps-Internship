# 2nd if statement
if (5,10):
print('hello')

# 3rd if statement
if (yes):
  print('hello')

# 4th if statement
if (5,10): print('hello')
```


2. Given the nested if-else below, what will be the value x when the code executed successfully.

```
x = 0
a = 6
b = 6
if a > 0:
    if b < 0: 
        x = x + 6 
    elif a > 6:
        x = x + 5
    else:
        x = x + 4
else:
    x = x + 3

print(x)
```


3. What does the following Python program display?

```bash
x = 3
if ( x == 0 ):
  print("Am I here?")
elif ( x == 3 ):
  print("Or here?")
print("Or over here?")
```

4. What is the output of the following python code?

```bash
a = 5
b = 10
if b < a:
  print("a is greater than b")
elif a == b:
  b = 5
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("b is greater than a")
```


5. What is the output of the following python code?

```bash
if 4 + 5 == 10:
    print("TRUE")
else:
    print("FALSE")
print("TRUE")
```

6. What is the output of the following python code?

```bash
x = -10
if x < 0:
    print("The negative number ",  x, " is not valid here.")
print("This is always printed")
```

7. What is the output of the following python code?

```bash
a = 5
b = 10
if b > a:
print("b is greater than a")
```
